### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I am a hands-on security professional who embraces healthy cultures of collaboration, automation, and tactical optimism in pursuit of fashioning safe and useful products. A tenured remote collaborator, open-source enthusiast, and builder at heart with experience managing and mentoring teams.

I live in the midwestern portion of the United States with my wife and two daughters.

I can be found on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chase-pettet/)

I have contributed odds and ends to a number of open-source projects over the years: [Diamond](https://github.com/python-diamond/Diamond/commits?author=chasemp|Diamond), [Logster](https://github.com/etsy/logster/commits?author=chasemp), [Semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-action/commits/develop/?author=chasemp|Semgrep), [Kubetools](https://github.com/collabnix/kubetools/commits?author=chasemp), [mwclient](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/commits?author=chasemp), [k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Achasemp+), [Mozilla AskNot](https://github.com/jdm/asknot/commits?author=chasemp), etc


I have made significant contributions to numerous open-source projects during my time at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/) across [security](https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet/commit/057dc2fa3aa24eba80d4e1f8e263b17743625543), [infrastructure](https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet/commits?author=chasemp&after=96514b822dc01686d6ca7367fe24a779b3f10167+34), and [reporting](https://github.com/chasemp/wikimedia-security-tooling-peek).  

The Wikimedia Foundation does not use Github as their authoritative respository source.  As of 2024, they use [Gerrit](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/q/status:open+-is:wip) and Phabricator's [Diffusion](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/commit/query/FZiBzYjORg1k/#R).
