### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a people manager and security professional (advocate, architect, engineer) who finds joy in building safe & useful things.

An emphasis on business enablement, risk informed decision making, automation, tactical optimism, and fostering healthy cultures of collaboration has helped me to build and grow successful initiatives across industries.

I have worked for companies behind globally ranked top 10 and 150 websites for a decade in these capacities. I have worked in highly regulated environments for a decade more (HIPAA, PCI DSS, FISMA, ISO 27001, FedRAMP). 

I am a lifelong builder and continuous learner who can often be found in the workshop. I live in the midwestern portion of the U.S. with my wife and two daughters.
