### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an information technology architecture and security professional with experience managing and mentoring teams.  I maintain an emphasis on risk informed decision making, tactical optimism, perseverance, and fostering healthy cultures of collaboration. I have worked for companies behind globally ranked top 10 and 150 websites for a decade in these capacities, as well as enterprises in highly regulated industries.  I am a lifelong builder and continuous learner who can often be found in the workshop.

I also enjoy pistachios.
